## E/Z

priority rules:

1) Higher atomic number precedes lower. 
2) Higher atomic mass precedes lower (in the case of isotopes)
   * Use exact isotopic mass when an isotope is indicated, and use average atomic weight when it is not
3) 'E' precedes 'Z'
4) Chiral stereogenic units precede pseudoasymmetric stereogenic units, and these precede nonstereogenic units
5) “r” precedes “s” 
6) An undifferentiated reference node has priority over any other undifferentiated node.
